# Lab03 Magic 8
For this lab, you will be building the functionality for a digital magic 8 ball.
# Step 1 -- Writing the Methods
For this lab, you will be expected to complete the following methods:
- decidePolarity(int magicNum)
- positiveAnswer(int magicNum)
- negativeAnswer(int magicNum)
- neutralAnswer(int magicNum)

For instructions on completing these methods, see the [Javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab03Magic8/).

# Step 2 -- Testing
Make sure to test your work. Some of the methods are tested for you in main, but be sure to add your own tests!
For this lab, running main will allow you to run go(), which should call your methods. However, because go() uses a random generator, it is recommended that you write additional tests with known numbers. Make sure to test the edge cases!

# Step 3 -- Turning It In
Once you're done writing and testing the methods, go ahead and submit your zip file containing your code to Canvas!
